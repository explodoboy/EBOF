A mod for Terra Invicta which allows for factions to become permanently unable to recruit councilors, by choking them out of influence.

It requires Unity Mod Manager to work (install using DoorstopProxy): https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21

The mod has three main functions; the influence drain, the influence disabler, and the influence cap. On the 15th, 30th, and 50th years respectively, a powerful influence drain is applied to all factions. By the 50th year, a faction needs the equivalent of 50% of the world in favor of it to simply survive. This guarentees most factions, unless they have extensive space infrastructure, end up unable to consistently generate influence.

The second function comes into play when a faction has no living councilors, no stored influence, and negative influence income. If all three conditions are met, the faction is incapable of storing influence whatsoever - they cannot suddenly come back into existence by being randomly given a bunch of influence from events. This isn't quite permanent - it can be reversed if the faction manages to generate 100 influence per month. This threshold can be adjusted or disabled, using Unity Mod Manager's mod settings functionality.

The third function sets a hard influence cap of 5000. The intent behind this is to allow storing a decent amount of influence, without making it an utter chore to whittle down a faction (such as the Servants). The cap also can be adjusted or disabled.
